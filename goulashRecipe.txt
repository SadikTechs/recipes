Goulash Ingredients

    Ground Beef – You can use lean ground beef or one with higher fat content. Drain any excess grease that is produced. Replace half the ground beef with 1 pound of Italian sausage or completely substitute the beef for ground turkey or chicken. 
    Minced Garlic – Adds flavor but can be coupled with Worcestershire sauce for even more flavor.
    Water – Beef broth can be used instead of water for extra flavor. Increase the amount of broth to make this dish more “soupy” like the Hungarian goulash.
    Tomato Sauce
    Diced Tomatoes
    Bay Leaves
    Soy Sauce
    Seasoned Salt
    Italian Seasoning
    Elbow Macaroni – Macaroni noodles are a classic, but any similarly sized pasta will work such as shell pasta, penne, ditalini, or fusilli.
    Shredded Cheddar Cheese – I love cheddar in our recipe, but shredded mozzarella or even Parmesan will work. Cheese can be omitted as well.
How to Make Goulash

    MEAT. Begin by sautéing beef/hamburger in a skillet over medium-high heat until cooked, and then drain. Add the garlic and sauté for about 5 minutes.
    SAUCE. Add water, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, bay leaves, soy sauce, and seasoned salt.
    SIMMER. Stir this well; cover and allow to simmer for about 15-20 minutes. Add the uncooked elbow macaroni to skillet, stir well, then return the lid and simmer for about 30 minutes.
    CHEESE. Once 30 minutes is up and the noodles are all cooked, turn off the heat, and remove the bay leaves. Add 1 cup of cheddar cheese right before serving, which will make it even more irresistible.

Make in a Crock Pot

Making this American goulash in the crockpot is super easy. Just follow these steps to make it:

    Sauté the ground beef in a skillet until cooked.
    Drain excess fat and add garlic. Sauté for another 5 minutes.
    Put the sautéed meat in the crock pot along with the remaining ingredients.
    Cook on HIGH heat for 3-4 hours or on LOW heat for 7-8 hours.
